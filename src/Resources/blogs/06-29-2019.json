But I learned something cool because of it. Essentially I was running a query that was checking if the updated time of a certain entry was greater than 30 minutes past the current time. This worked super well on my machine here at home and for my group so what the hell, I pushed it. "

But the fix was easy, always use the programming language's time! That way instead of comparing it against NOW in PSQL you can just take the current time in whatever language you're using!"

I plan to expirement with it more in the future. Teamwork is never easy but the team did pretty well considering the short amount of time we had to work on the project."
