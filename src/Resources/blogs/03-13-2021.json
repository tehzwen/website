It's a bit bitter sweet as I am excited to be able to do more development at work from a coding perspective, but I will miss the team I am currently on as they are really wonderful people and have been a pleasure to work with."

But more than that I want to start revisting old projects I had worked on in the past and cleaning them up. One in particular has been bugging me alot lately that I want to clean up quite a bit! So yeah that's whats been going on with me, I'm hopeful for a Covid 19 vaccine soon and look forward to finishing off some projects this year."
