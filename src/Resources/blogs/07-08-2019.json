Recently, I've used Semantic UI alot with React and it's been really nice using their Grid system which works really nicely with making pages responsive and what not so I applied it to this site (which was previously using bootstrap)."

Anyways, that's all I've added for now. I've been working on a webGL multiplayer game lately so stay tuned for that post and I'll add it to the projects page as well."
